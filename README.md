# GeneticAlgorithm
Solver for DNA chain sequencing problems, using standard fixed-length oligonucleotide libraries and assuming the presence of negative or positive errors in the input data, respectively, can be formulated as follows. The term "ideal spectrum" means a complete and error-free set of words of equal length l that can be extracted in a sequence of length n, where l â‰¤ n.
